# movielisting

#### Movie List App is a simple javascript project which fetch and display the movie list to the user.

- This app uses the open-source movie API from TMDB to create a movie listing.
- Lazy loading technique is used to load the movies and once loaded the movies are displayed in grid format category wise.
- Search capability is added to search for a particular film in the list irrespective of the category.
- Pagination concept is used to display the movie. This is done in server side to avoid the delay in fetching all 1000 or more movies in -single take.Instead we load 20  data for every page and this avoids the delay in fetching data from backend.
